		    		<h2>Navigation Bar</h2>
		    		<p>Starting from the navigation menu, it contains every page that is required for the assignment. The title on the top left side of the navigation bar is a 'label' tag used to portray each page's title.The shadow effect used on navigation menu is used for the text to have a glowing 3d effect.</p>
                       <p>For a responsive navigation bar, it operates after the screen pixels gets below 801 widths.</p>
                       <p>The burger icon is 
                          made by a div using a 2px height, 18px width element to form a single dash and then using before sector and after sector to insert more element on the top and the bottom of the element to make it appear like a hamburger icon. The menu scrolls down without overlapping other elements.</p>
                          <p>However, the code is not my own, but I've learned it from a youtube tutorial titled <mark style="background:lightblue;">"Responsive Pure CSS Menu Tutorial(No Javascript)"</mark> from the channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCETveVX7TPauIupxYz6sFtA">'FollowAndrew'</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjrp1FEHnyA&t=1393s">The video.</a> [Accessed  29 May 2021]</p>

		    		<p>I got the background image for the home page from<a href="https://wallpaperaccess.com/dark-website"> Here.</a>[Accessed 20 May 2021]</p>
		    		<p>The self-writing animation is the work of the keyframe used on the greeting text. The text was first positioned then been regulated with the syntax ‘animation’. The given name to the tag is ‘typing, blinking’ (typing being the self typing animation, blink is the insertion cursor animation.)   On 2.5seconds, and in 22 steps, the writing animation completes itself. The blink is set to infinite, where it is set as a loop for 1second delays.</p>

		    			<p>The images holder for the portfolio is made with a display grid. There are four containers in total 3rows and 2colums—each with the same width but different height. The text-only appears while hovering is because the rbg-alpha has been set to 0.0 for the text to be hidden, and on hover, it has the full-color value. I was able to learn the entire grid property thanks to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid_container.asp">W3schools.</a>[Accessed 22 May 2021]</p>

		    			<p>Pressing the contact us button will open a pop-up form. The process started with making the form first and maintaining its position to the centre, then changing the display to none. A checkbox was used to display the form container while in a checked state; the container for the form is displayed while unchecked the display remains none for the container, so it doesn't appear on the screen. The id for the checkbox is 'show', and with the help of 'label' syntax for the id, I was able to customize the size for the "contact us" button, which is also the checkbox.</p>
		    			<p>To do so, I had to learn the codes from a youtube <a href="https://youtu.be/3vVUXnhSc7w">video </a>from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk7xIEmd3MeyhIu2StLX5yA">CodingNepal.</a></p>
		    			<p>Form action mailto is applied; submitting the form will open your default mail application. There is no way to redirect the message to us as I'm inexperienced in coding and limited to the languages.</p>

		    			<h2>Footer</h2>
		    			<p>At the semi bottom of the page, I have used a footer tag it includes my social media account. The icon that I've used are from '<a href="https://fontawesome.com/start">font awesome 5</a>' on the footer. The icon size and color are maintained in Html and the background in the CSS . on the hover effect, I have set the transform scale to a 1:1 ratio for it to appear like it's stretching upwards. The color gradient has been used for it to have a more authentic look.</p>

		    			<h2>Issues and Resolving</h2>
		    			<p>I faced the issue, having to rearrange my codes as some of them did not pass the validation check as I was not aware that some syntax couldn't be used as child elements. And without the meta tag, the character encoding of the HTML document is not declared, so I had to add "meta charset=" UTF-8." after looking it up on the web. The HTML lang attribute was necessary to identify the language of text content on the web. <br>Find the validated images below. Clicking on it will open the image to another page, and you can get a clear visualization.</p>

		    			<p>The assignment was an enjoyable thing to do as it has drastically improved my skills by implying the 'term 1' learning to use. 
                   I've tried to make the website look as authentic as possible, with the colours being complementary, and avoided using unnecessary decoration. I believe I can bring significant changes when there is no limitation to the languages, as I have yet to learn 90% more of what I've learned. I look forward to learning more about web development as it has intrigued my interest.</p>
